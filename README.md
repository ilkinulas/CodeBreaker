#CodeBreaker

This is a demo Unity3D project developed for [GDG Istanbul Workshop @PeakGames](http://www.meetup.com/GDGIstanbul/events/229573477/)

It is a simple (and modified) implementation of [MasterMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) board game.

The aim of this project is to practice:

* Unit Testing in Unity3D
* Writing integration tests for game scenes
* Using dependency injection for modularity and easy testing
* Separating the view and the rest of the game by applying MVCS pattern.

[StangeIOC](http://strangeioc.github.io/strangeioc/) is used as a dependency injection framework.

This project uses [Kenney Assets](http://kenney.nl/assets for graphics and audio.
